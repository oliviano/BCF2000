## PRESETS NOTES:
Preset 6 & 7 differ by the way the rotary encoder display their info ( pan vs dot mode ) and preset 6 use relative encoding whereas preset 7 use absolute encoding.

Preset 10 to 12 differ just by the faders channels, so one can control more than 8 fader in resolume by changing presets on the controller.
